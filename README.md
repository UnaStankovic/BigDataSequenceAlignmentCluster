# BigDataSequenceAlignmentCluster
This project is a part of my PhD studies at Faculty of Mathematics, University of Belgrade. The project is big data sequence alignment cluster using CouchDB.


Firstly, setup CouchDB to work on 2-3 nodes and create database.
  Very important step is to setup addresses of nodes in vm.args in couchdbx-core folder!
  Check addresses with ifconfig in the terminal.

  Create a non-partitioning database within CouchDB UI.

  Database import is done with module:
  https://github.com/glynnbird/couchimport

  sudo npm install -g couchimport
  export COUCH_URL="http://admin:admin@192.168.0.13:5984"

  export COUCH_DATABASE="sequences_data"
  export COUCH_DELIMITER=","
  cat records_file.csv | couchimport

Secondly, setup npm with:
- nano 
- restify
- uuid
